# FinalProject
We created Meet Me There because we are all eager to travel and wanted to make it easy to plan trips for groups of people and decide where to go.

We used the Yelp Fusion API to return business listings in multiple categories that can be sorted by price range and location. Users can make accounts, join and update groups, create and delete events, and vote on their most favorite or least favorite places from the API results.

We used Java, Spring Boot/MVC Framework, HTML, JSP, CSS, Javascript, and MySQL to make it all possible.

What sets our app apart is the ability for group members to vote on favorites to come to a consensus on where to go.
